# low-level-graphics






I went into with a simple drawing of a persons face. Using the shapes that consist of two circles for eyes, an arc for the nose, and two ellipses one for the shape of the mouth and the other for the inside of the mouth. Wrote up the background and blited it from pygames. Felt like the library itself was easy to use and fun to craft something up in the engine. I learn the overall functions of shapes in the library, and not only that being able to craft something up quick in a engine is sorta invaluable. I also think it was annoying to learn just mashing things against the plane just trying to get it in certain spots correctly. Overall just created a simple image in pygame library and using the math library, but it was fun.
